# PHP Server Side Scripting
This was my introduction to PHP, it goes without saying that all of this code is so insecure in so many ways but for what it was when I wrote it it's not that bad.

This is a simple motorcycle blog site. I don't have the database file but if I ever wanted to make something like this for a production I'd use something like WordPress so it's not that important to me.
